# OP-1-Reason-Remotemap
Tweaked Reason Remotemap for Teenage Engineering OP-1. Modwheel is mainly mapped to the Blue encoder. Devices with macro rotaries are mapped to the other encoders. Macrobuttons are mapped to the Sound buttons. On REs and VSTs without macro rotaries, the green encoder is mapped to filter frequency.
