# OP-1-Reason-Remotemap
Tweaked Reason Remotemap for Teenage Engineering OP-1. Modwheel is mainly mapped to the Blue encoder. Devices with macro rotaries are mapped to the other encoders. Macrobuttons are mapped to the Sound buttons. On RE without macro rotaries, the green encoder is mapped to filter frequency.

Added support for following devices:

- RE Polysix
- RE Antidote
- VST VPS Angenger
- VST Synth1 (x64)
- VST Serum
